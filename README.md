# Transformer Architecture Implementation

[![Transformer Architecture](https://github.com/nares10/transformer-implementation/blob/main/images/Screenshot%202025-03-02%20074643.png)

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of the Transformer architecture based on the seminal paper [Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). The project is designed for ease of experimentation and learning for myself

## Overview

The Transformer model leverages multi-head self-attention and positional encoding to efficiently process sequential data. This implementation includes:
- **Multi-Head Attention:** Scaled dot-product attention across multiple heads.
- **Positional Encoding:** Adds fixed sinusoidal positional embeddings to token representations.
- **Feed-Forward Networks:** Two-layer fully-connected networks within each encoder and decoder block.
- **Modular Encoder and Decoder Layers:** Easily customizable for research and experimentation.

## Features

- **PyTorch Implementation:** Clean, modular code for both encoder and decoder stacks.
- **Customizable:** Extendable components for attention mechanisms, positional encodings, and feed-forward networks.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) (v1.8 or later)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/transformer-architecture.git
